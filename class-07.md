# HTML Tables; JS Constructor Functions

## HTML Chapter 6 : Tables

* A table represents information in a grid format.
* Each block in the grid is referred to as a table cell.
* `<table>` is used to creat a table.
* `<tr>` is used to create a table row.
* `<td>` represents each cell of the table, stands for table data.
* `<th>` is used just like the `<td>` element but its purpose is to represent either the heading for a column or a row.
* You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
* For long tables, you can split the table into a `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>`.

## JS Chapter 3: Functions, Methods, and Objects.

* The **new** keyword and the object constructor create a blank object. You can then add properties and methods to the object.
* To update the value of properties, use dot notation or square brackets. They work on objects created using literal or constructor notation. To delete a property, use the **delete** keyword and then use dot notation to identify the property or method you want to remove.
* The **this** keyword is used instead of the object name to indicate the property or method belongs to the object that this function creates.
* You can create new **instances** of the object using the constructor function. The **new** keyword followed by a call to the function creates a new object. The properties of each object are given as arguments to the function.
* The `+=` operator is used to add content to an existing variable.
* You use the dot notation to add properties to objects.
* Literal Notation: a colon separates the key/value pairs. There is a comma between each key/value pair.
* Object Constructor notation: The function can be used to create multiple objects. The `.this` keyword is used instead of the object name. The `this` keyword always means one object, usually the object in which the function operates.
* When a function is created at the top of a script, then it is in the global scope or global context.
* Arrays are a special type of object. they hold a related set of key/value pairs, but the key for each value is its index number.
* An **object model** is a group of objects, each of which represents things from the real world.
* JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that allows you to write scripts.
* Arrays and object can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).
