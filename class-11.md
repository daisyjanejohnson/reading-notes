## HTML Chapter 16: Images

* You can control the size of an image using the **width**  and **height** properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box.
* In order to center an image, it should be turned into a block-level element using the **display** property with a value of block. To center it you can either:
  1. use the **text-align** property with a value of **center** on the containing element.
  1. On the image itself, you can use the **margin**  property and set the values of the left and right margins to **auto**.
* The **background-image** property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element.
* You can use a background image once or have it repeated across the page. 
* You can create image rollover effects by moving the background-position of an image.
* to reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create image sprites. An image **sprite** is when a single image is used for several different parts of an interface.
