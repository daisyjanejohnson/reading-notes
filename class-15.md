# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team.

*  Google researched on what made the perfect team and found out some things.
* It was best when managers were great communicators and didn't micromanage.
* There is not a special mix of people that make up a good team, the "who" doesn't seem to matter.
* Group norms are the traditions, behavioral standards, and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather.
* As long as everyone in a group has a chance to talk, the team does well. But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.
* Being aware of how others are feeling based on their tone of voice, ecpressions, and other nonverbal cues are important for a successful team.
* Psychological safety is a shared belief held by members of that team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking. (IT allows you to be comfortable being yourself.) Conversational turn-taking and empathy help promote this.
